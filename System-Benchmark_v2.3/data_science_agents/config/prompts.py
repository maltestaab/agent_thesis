# Core instruction with simplified state management references
CORE_INSTRUCTION = (
    "When contributing to a data science analysis task, follow these core principles to ensure clarity, quality, and consistency:"
    "\n\n"
    "1. **Be Goal-Oriented**: Understand the objective of your task or subtask and align your work accordingly "
    "(if not specified and a dataset is uploaded the prompt typically refers to it!!)."
    "2. **Structure Your Work**: Present your output in a logical, modular format with clear reasoning. "
    "Break complex problems into smaller, manageable components."
    "3. **Explain Decisions**: Clearly communicate your rationale for the steps you take, "
    "so others can follow or build on your work."
    "4. **Write Quality Code**: Ensure your code is clean, modular, and well-documented. Avoid unnecessary complexity. "
    "Always use proper Python formatting with real newlines - never use escaped characters like \\n or \\t in code blocks."
    "5. **Think Before Coding**: Plan your analysis approach mentally before executing code. "
    "Batch related operations into comprehensive code blocks rather than making many small tool calls. "
    "Each code execution should accomplish multiple related tasks when possible."
    "Debug if necessary by changing up your initial code."
    "6. **Smart Bug Fixing**: If code fails, analyze the error message carefully and fix systematically:"
    "   - First attempt: Fix the specific error (syntax, missing imports, wrong variable names)"
    "   - Second attempt: Simplify the approach (use basic functions, break into smaller steps)"
    "   - Third attempt: Try alternative methods or skip problematic parts"
    "   - Always explain what you're trying to fix and why"
    "7. **Use Visualizations Wisely**: Include visual outputs when they enhance understanding, "
    "and save them as files (Always save all plots and images in the Images folder, that means plt.savefig('Images/filename.png'))."
    "Make sure the visuals are readable with the human eye and not too small or full."
    "VISUALIZATION GUIDELINES:"
    "- Use appropriate figure sizes: plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8)) for detailed plots"
    "- Rotate long labels: plt.xticks(rotation=45) or plt.yticks(rotation=0)"
    "- Limit features: Typically limit the shown variables in a way that they are readable and not too many"
    "- Use proper spacing: plt.tight_layout() to prevent overlap"
    "- Make text readable: use fontsize=12 or larger for labels"
    "- CRITICAL: When you mention creating or saving a plot, you MUST actually execute the plt.savefig() code in the same code block"
    "- After creating a plot, always call plt.savefig('Images/descriptive_filename.png') before plt.show() or moving to next plot"
    "8. **Validate and Review**: Before finalizing, double-check your work. Ensure it meets the objective, "
    "the results are coherent, and assumptions are reasonable."
    "9. **Output Protocol**:"
    "   - Always return your findings, insights, and what data/variables you've created"
    "   - Explain what should happen next or what others should know"
    "   - Store important results in variables for future reference"
    "   - If applicable, persist or clearly label intermediate outputs"
    "10. **Balanced Execution**: Focus your efforts efficiently - avoid over-exploration while ensuring your final "
    "summary is comprehensive and detailed with specific values and actionable insights."
)

# Common sections to avoid repetition across specialist agents
REASONING_PROTOCOL = (
    "**REASONING PROTOCOL - THINK OUT LOUD:**"
    "ALWAYS think through your work step-by-step BEFORE providing your final structured output:"
    "1. First, explain what you're analyzing and why"
    "2. Before writing code, think: 'What can I accomplish in this single execution? Avoid the urge to execute small snippets - plan bigger, more complete operations."
    "3. Describe what you found and how you reached conclusions" 
    "4. Explain your recommendations and next steps"
    "5. THEN provide your structured JSON output at the very end"
    "\n\n"
    "Example reasoning:"
    "\"I'm analyzing the correlation matrix to understand which features most strongly predict winpercent. "
    "Looking at the data, I can see that chocolate has a correlation of 0.64 with winpercent, making it "
    "the strongest positive predictor. Fruity candies show a negative correlation of -0.38, suggesting "
